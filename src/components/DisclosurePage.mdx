csspurge.com is a personal blog to help you improve your craft and share my journey as a web designer.

We use affiliate links as a way to help us support the running of this blog.

If you click on one of these links and make a purchase, csspurge.com will earn a commission, at no extra cost to you because the products are the same price as if you bought them without going through an affiliate link.

To keep up with the industry, I have taken on courses to help sharpen the skills and explore new technologies.

We're careful about the products/services we recommend.

So if you purchase a product/service with an affiliate link on this site, it is a great way to support us.

Affiliate links are marked, so you can make an informed decision.

Stay hungry!
