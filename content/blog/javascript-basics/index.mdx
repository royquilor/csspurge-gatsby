Javascript is client Site:
  - render: change the display
  - post: send data
  - get: fetch more data from the server

Browsers use an engine to execute code like Javascript:
  - Chrome: v8
  - Firefox: gecko
  - Safari: webkit

Client side front end frameworks are built on top of Javascript:
   - React
   - Angular
   - Vue
   - Svelte

Javascript is an interpreted code which means it is read line by line instead of compiled code.

JIT known as Just in time compiler is used to speed up the engines.

Server side:
  - node js
  - api
  - database
  - servers

Variables:
  1. Primitives: numbers, text or booleans (true or false)
  2. Compound: arrays or objects

Now use:
  1. let = if it will change
  2. const = name

Arrays are like lists
Objects are like dictionaries

The DOM or the document object
structure of the html
load the page and elements
uses browser API
